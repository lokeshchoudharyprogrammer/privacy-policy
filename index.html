  <h1>Privacy Policy for My Food Analytics App</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 28-02-2025</p>
  
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    My Food Analytics App ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy.

  <h2>4. Storage and Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Supabase</strong> for secure data storage and management, and <strong>Cloudflare</strong> for deployment and enhanced security. While we implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
  </p>
